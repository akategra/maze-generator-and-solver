# Maze Generator and Solver

## Description:

This project uses java's **swing GUI** to simulate a generation and solution of a random maze. This demonstration creates a random maze and uses breadth-first search to find the shortest path between the starting position 0,0 and the diagonally opposite position. This code was submitted as part of the final project of my
3rd semester course of **Data Structures and Algorithms.**

## User Input:

When successfully executing the launch code file, the user will be required to enter the grid size in the console. Enter the grid size separated by a comma. After entering the dimension, a window(JFrame) will popup simulating the generation of the maze. After successful generation, user can use the **Find Path** button to simulate a breadth-first search
to find the shortest path. 
The user then can use the **Generate Path** button to view the shortest path back to the starting position.
